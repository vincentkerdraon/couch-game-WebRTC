                The goal of this POC is to showcase how WebRTC can be used to enable seamless peer-to-peer
                communication,
                allowing players to connect and interact in real-time without the need for a centralized server.

            <ol class="text-start">
                <li>Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports WebRTC (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).</li>
                <li>Open this application in your browser, for example on your smart-TV.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the "host" part.</li>
                <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to connect with another player, for example with your phone.</li>
                <li>Test the real-time communication features.</li>
